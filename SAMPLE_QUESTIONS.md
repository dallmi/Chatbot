## Notes for Chatbot Implementation

1. **Date handling:** Users will refer to dates naturally ("this month", "last week", "Q3", "October"). The chatbot needs to convert these to `visitdatekey` ranges.

2. **Engagement rate:** Calculate as `(likes + comments) / views * 100`

3. **Reach rate:** Calculate as `unique_visitors / total_employees * 100`. Note: Total employee count needs to be provided as a parameter or stored separately, as it's not in the analytics data.

4. **Channel = referrerapplicationid:** Map user terms like "Email channel" to the `referrerapplicationid` column.

5. **Content type questions:** May refer to `contenttype`, `theme`, `topic`, or `newscategory` - clarify if ambiguous.

6. **Region/Division:** Default to employee's region (`employeeregion`) and division (`employeebusinessdivision`), not content target region.

7. **"Best performing":** Could mean highest UV, most views, or best engagement rate - may need clarification.

8. **Journey/Funnel analysis:** Requires sessionization logic - tracking which pages a user visited in sequence. This may require additional data modeling beyond the current fact table structure.

9. **Strategic content:** Map terms like "CEO message", "Strategy update", "leadership communications" to specific pages, themes, or news categories.

10. **Target audience matching:** Compare `targetregion`/`targetorganization` from page_inventory with actual visitor `employeeregion`/`employeebusinessdivision` to assess targeting effectiveness.
